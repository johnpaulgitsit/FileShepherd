## Learning
While working on this project, I deepened my understanding of Spring Security and best practices in application security. I also strengthened my skills in Spring Boot and Java, incorporating environment variables for configuration management and implementing secure password hashing and storage techniques. On the front end, I enhanced my proficiency with React by integrating dynamic functionality and user interactions.

This version serves as a foundational build, and I plan to expand it into a more robust and feature-rich application in future iterations.
